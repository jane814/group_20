    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning in categorizing stocks based on risk-return profiles to optimize investment portfolios. We use historical stock market data, including daily prices, volatility, and financial ratios, to represent stock characteristics. Through clustering techniques and dimensionality reduction, we hope to identify distinct categories that reflect different risk-return dynamics. Additionally, performance will be measured by evaluating portfolio stability compared to traditional methods, which will show us how useful unsupervised learning is for predicting stocks in real-world situations. We offer specific insights into applying unsupervised learning for stock prediction, focusing on Apple Inc's  data from 1980 to 2021.\n"

    "# Background\n",
     "A stock market is a market where people are able to purchase shares from public companies. These shares can help an individual gain profits, the company to raise capital, and provide people a way to invest in companies they believe have potential<a name=\"simplilearn\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>]<a name=\"simplilearn"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial/stock-price-prediction-using-machine-learning#what_is_the_stock_market). It is for these reasons that finding a way to predict how stock market prices may change is crucial. \n",
     "\n",
    "The stock market is known to be extremely unpredictable and full of unknown variables, which can influence stock prices one way or another.  For many years, researchers have been working to try to predict stock prices. However, this has been quite difficult with the presence of unexpected variables like the pandemic. Therefore, analysts have instead tried to focus on short term predictions that estimate how the stock market could’ve changed. Since the stock market is so complex considering the many variables influencing its change, AI steps in to help us process these variables. \n", 
     "\n",
    "There are already several different types of models used to predict the stock market, and two different ways to analyze the stocks. Fundamental analysis looks at a company stock’s intrinsic value and analyzes historical as well as current data. They are used mainly with long-term investments. Technical analysis looks at measurable data of the stock activities as well as analyzing present and historical data for short-term investments. In addition, technical analysis is influenced by current news while fundamental analysis is not really affected by them. In the case of Neptune a.i, they have chosen to use technical analysis with a Long Short Term Memory framework to build a model to predict the stock market. \n",
     "\n",
    "South Dakota State University has also developed their own A.I model, dubbed “ALERTA-NET” where they have incorporated macroeconomic data in their model which have resulted in more accurate predictions. It is examples like these that stand to prove that researchers are still looking to build models that can predict the stock market with higher accuracy. The uncertainty of the stock market makes this task so difficult, and the importance of the stock market in terms of the economy as well as profits makes the pursuit of accurate stock market prediction models so crucial. \n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts Apple's future stock prices for the years 1980 to 2021, using past data from Yahoo Finance. We will use Time Series Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors that influence Apple's historical stock performance. To measure our model's accuracy, we will use Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which quantify the accuracy of our predictions of actual stock prices. Additionally, our problem is highly replicable in financial markets, where investors and analysts often look for such forecasts to make their decisions. For an ML-relevant solution, we will use time series forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM networks. These models will analyze historical stock prices and relevant financial indicators to predict future stock movements."

    "\n",
    "Our solution aims to predict stock price movements using primarily unsupervised machine learning techniques. The focus will be on exploring the underlying patterns and structures in the stock market data without relying on labeled outcomes. The insights gained from unsupervised learning will then be used to inform a simple supervised model for price prediction.\n",

    "**Unsupervised Learning for Feature Extraction and Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clustering for Market Segmentation**: We will use clustering algorithms, such as K-means and DBSCAN, to segment stocks based on historical price movements, trading volume, and other financial indicators. This will help us identify groups of stocks with similar behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) will be applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its structure. This will assist in visualizing the stock market data and identifying key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Association Rule Mining**: We will explore association rule mining to uncover relationships between different stocks or financial indicators. This can reveal interesting patterns, such as stocks that tend to move together.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning for Price Prediction**\n",
    "\n",
    "After extracting insights and features using unsupervised techniques, we will employ a simple supervised learning model to predict stock price movements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistic Regression**: Based on the features and patterns identified through unsupervised learning, we will use logistic regression to predict whether a stock's price will go up or down in the next trading period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Evaluation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate the performance of our unsupervised models using metrics such as silhouette score (for clustering quality) and reconstruction error (for dimensionality reduction). The supervised logistic regression model will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
